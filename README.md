Basic Project - 1:

Project connecting Unity and MySQL. MAMP (https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/) was used to have the DB locally. 

Created following and updating this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5KbKbJ6Gf99mcmE1ptsn0oXO1_vnKDlS.



PHPScripts folder contains the different PHP scripts used for this project, but you have to put the files in your correct folder.


--> The URL specified in the Unity scripts has to be the one where you are hosting the DB. In this case, because MAMP was used to have it locally, it was: http://localhost/sqlconnect/"fileName.php". The folder of these files has to be specified in the MAMP Server: MAMP-->Preferences-->Server and check/decide your document root.
